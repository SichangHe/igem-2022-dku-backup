## Part improvement

Our part [BBa_K4161301](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4161301) is an improvement of part [BBa_K416000](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K416000) from iGEM10_NYU (2010).

In 2010, iGEM10_NYU designed the part “BBa_K416000” which was the CDS of Aga2 protein for yeast surface display. The part was achieved by deleting the stop codon of the Aga2 CDS region from vector pCTCON2 so that the element can be fused with other fragments to express fusion proteins.

On the basis of this part, we designed the integrated expression module “BBa_K4161301”. This part integrated the yeast surface protein Aga2, GAL1 promotor, nanobody 20ipaD, and 3xFLAG tag sequences, which make it a complete expression module that is controllable. The addition of GAL1 promotor ensures the whole surface display part would only be induced by galactose and denied the leaky expression. The nanobody segment provides the real function for the whole module so that it can bind to its corresponding antigen to inhibit pathogens like Shigella. Additionally, the 3xFLAG tag eases the detection of the expression of this module.
