# Model
Models are powerful tools in terms of imagining reasonable future scenarios. Also, 
assumptions and results from the model push us to reflect on the present situation 
and make adjustments to our existing plans and experiments, which might also develop 
our final goal into a more realistic version.

There are 2 modeling sections in our project:

- **Visualization**\
  This section mainly shows the structure of proteins and their docking results,
  and also tries to provide guides for future experiment design.

- **Description and Prediction of durg efficacy**\
  This section mainly describes the efficiency of protein expression, and tries to 
  predict the scenario after a patient 
  takes the drug.
