## Hardware

Probiotics will be sealed in microcapsules(**Figure 1**) made of shellac
before being delivered into bodies. The pH-dependent solubility that prefers
a mild basic environment makes shellac perfect for releasing probiotics in the intestines.

**Figure 1** | 3D model of the microcapsule

Microcapsule is a microscope-scale capsulation format.
The probiotics were wrapped in materials that can ensure the reservation,
activation, release, and environmental-resistance of the probiotics.
It would be presented as powder.
“Microencapsulation is a technology that serves as a tool to protect the
sensitive and expensive nutrients (Meyers et al., 1998), by providing them with
a protective wall,
which allows them to get released at a particular site, at a particular time,
and under particular conditions."[^Microencapsulation]
To summarize, the technology of
microencapsulation is to ensure the safe delivery of the sensitive compound.

Shellac is a natural polymer that is generally recognized as a safe (GRAS) material.
It is insoluble in neutral and acidic aqueous solutions but dissolves at alkaline conditions
[^pH_shellac].
So, shellac is proper for the controlled release of Yeast cells in the intestine.

Research has shown that the microcapsules with the addition of shellac
"contributed to better probiotic survivals after freeze drying, simulated digestion, heating and ambient storage,
and whey protein isolate (WPI) addition had a synergistic effect."[^Shellac]
