## Infection Precaution

The end-products of our project are small tablets or capsules that contain dry
powders of probiotics that express anti-*Shigella* antibodies on their surface.
Our products serve the dual roles of *Shigella* infection precaution as well as
disease therapy. The abilities of room temperature storage provide our tablets
with cost reduction for storage and transportation. Tablets should be taken
when facing potential exposure to *Shigella* infection sources, such as drinking
unsanitary water in high diarrhea incidence areas. In consideration of the
prevalent transmission pathways of *Shigella*, we also suggest people whose
family members have developed *Shigella* infections and children in school with
diarrhea cases take our tablets to prevent person-to-person transmission, which
is the major form of *Shigella* spreading[^Kotloff,2018].

## Infection Therapy

Due to the intracellular nature of *Shigella*, the effectiveness of antibodies
reduces as pathogens evade the cells. The ability to reprogram the
infected cells to form protrusion adjacent cells allows *Shigella* to spread
within intestine epithelial cells, reducing the chance of exposure to the body's
internal environment[^Sansonetti,1994]. This special characteristic
implies antibody may not be a one-size-fits-all solution for different stages
of infection. We call for the combination of clinical phases of antibiotics
treatment with our tablets together.

## Prognosis and Secondary infection

Along with the high household transmission rates, *Shigella* also displays high
secondary infection rates. Therefore, we suggest families with members
developing *Shigella* take our pills for some time to provide continuous
protection apart from keeping good hygiene conditions. In the meanwhile, patients
who have developed *Shigella* infection before should also take our tablets when
facing a second exposure.

## End Users

People who are exposed to potential *Shigella* infection sources, especially in a
household environment.
Children in school with *Shigella* cases were reported.
People with antibiotic allergies cannot use clinical antibiotic treatment.
Governments aim to provide low-cost solutions for *Shigella* incidence in
low- and middle-income, less-developed regions.

## Caveats

Our product contains exogenous antibody proteins. Therefore, an allergy test may
be needed to be performed to prevent possible anaphylaxis. Besides, considering the
pathogenesis and transmission pathway of *Shigella*, our products may not be a
one-size-fits-all solution for all infection stages but focuses more on the
prevention of infection.
