# Description and Prediction of drug efficacy

## Overview:
Wet lab results showed that we have successfully expressed 20ipaD on the surface
of Yeast. Our goal is to describe
efficiency of expression and predict the scenario after the drug is released in the
patient's jejunal.

### Part 1: Protein expression efficiency
To describe how efficient is Yeast concerning the expression of 20ipaD, we manually
calculated the efficiency by counting the number of Yeast cells that expressed
20ipaD and the total number of Yeast cells (**Figure 1**).

### Part 2: Prediction of post-medication scenario
