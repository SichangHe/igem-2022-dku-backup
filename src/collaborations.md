# Collaborations

## LZU,CCiC
We collaborated with LZU, another iGEM team focusing on probiotics, on education. We found that there are many misleading claims about probiotics and their effects in the market, so we planned to conduct science promotion in local areas to improve people's understanding of probiotics. We chose a local international university to give a lecture on science popularization, and more than 300 middle and high school students and teachers attended.
