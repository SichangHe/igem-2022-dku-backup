## CCiC Meetup

In order to carry out science communications on a larger scale, we participated
the 9th CCiC Conference (Conference of China iGEMer Community), which is a
national summit independently initiated by Chinese iGEM teams, aiming to
provide a platform for iGEM teams to share resources and promote mutual
learning and communication. We made poster and presented at the conference,
answering questions from the audience and judges. After the conference, we
collaborated with team LZU on science popularization about probiotics.

## Collaboration with LZU-PRO-A

During our collaboration with LZU-PRO-A, we identified the main products in probiotics
market: daily probiotics, feminine probiotics,
anti-stress probiotics, enzymes, and hair & nails products. Because of the geographical
differences of the two teams, our investigation,
we decided to provide an educational brochure for probiotic treatment and conduct
educational activities in local high schools.
Regardless of the time differences across continents, we were able to meet online
discuss the details of our educational content.
A brochure was designed and distributed during the local school meetup.
