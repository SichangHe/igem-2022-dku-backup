## Collaboration with Duke iGEM Team

### Duke-DKU iGEM History

Duke Kunshan University (DKU) is Duke University's sister school in Kunshan, China. Like Duke, DKU set out to provide a transformative and innovative education to students around the world. In addition, students are given the opportunity to study abroad in both semesters, further cementing our status as sister schools. Since taking its inaugural class of undergraduate students in 2018, DKU only had its very first iGEM team. Duke, on the other hand, has competed in the competition ever since 2006. Thus, when we learned about their interest in iGEM, we were beyond happy and excited to build a strong partnership between our teams.

### Our Partnership

Since DKU iGEM only started in 2021, we continued to look to Duke iGEM for support and guidance. This year, we met on Duke campus and gave each other suggestions. We shared the trouble shooting processes of our wet labs and reached mutual agreement to construct a PCR trouble shooting guide for future iGEM teams to use.

In order to carry out science communications on a larger scale, we participated
the 9th CCiC Conference (Conference of China iGEMer Community), which is a
national summit independently initiated by Chinese iGEM teams, aiming to
provide a platform for iGEM teams to share resources and promote mutual
learning and communication. We made poster and presented at the conference,
answering questions from the audience and judges. After the conference, we
collaborated with team LZU on science popularization about probiotics.
