## Introduction

This page will give a detailed record about the experiment results, future plans & project achievements.  

## Experiment Results

### Yeast

### *Lactococcus lactis*

### *Escherichia coli*

#### Summary of Experiment Design
We plan to display the nanobody JPS-G3 agianst the *Shigella* antigen ipaD on the surface of E.*coli* Nissle 1917 via the curli fiber protein *csg*A [^Gelfat,2021]. We expect the engineered E.*coli* Nissle 1917 to be capable of capturing the pathogen *Shigella flexneri* via antigen-antibody specific binding. Please check the detailed experiment design at 'design' part.

#### Plasmid Extraction
pUC19-JPS-G3-3xHA and pUC19-ipaD-3xHA were extracted using the TIANGEN plasmid extraction kit.

#### Target Sequence Amplification
Using following primers (**Table 1**), the JPS-G3-3xHA and ipaD-3xHA sequences were successfully amplified, and the results were verified by gel electrophoresis (**Figure 1**). PCR products were purified for further manipulation.

#### Molecular Cloning for Cytoplasmic Protein Expression
In order to construct the recombinant plasmids pET30a-ipaD-3xHA and pET30a-JPS-G3-3xFLAG, the PCR products obtained from the last step were digested by endonucleases *Bam*HI and *Xho*I to create sticky ends. Meanwhile, the pET30a plasmids were transformed into E.*coli* DH5a competent cells for propagation. After transformation and overnight culture, the extracted plasmids were also digested with endonucleases *Bam*HI and *Xho*I to create sticky ends. Afterwards, the digested plasmids and target sequences were ligated and transformed into E.*coli* DH5a competent cells (**Figure 2**).

Single colonies were picked from the plates and the inserted sequence were verified by colony PCR (**Figure 3**) and Sanger sequencing.

#### Overlap Extension PCR
In order to construct the recombinant DNA sequences csgA-JPS-G3-3xFLAG and csgA-ipaD-3xHA, the following overlap extension PCR primers are used (**Table 2**).
