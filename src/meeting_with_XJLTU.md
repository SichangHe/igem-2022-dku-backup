## Meeting with XJTLU-CHINA

### Getting acquainted

This year, we found that another iGEM team XJTLU is also working on
expressing fusion protein.
Specifically, they plan to engineer *E. coli* to express csgA protein at high levels
and immobilize the bacteria into a filter.
In that way, the heavy metal ions in the wastewater can be captured by csgA protein
that is expressed by *E. coli* located in the filter. Overall, they plan to develop a
biofilter core to replace current industry filter cores for heavy metal wastewater.\
Therefore, we decided to arrange a meeting to share each other's idea of this topic
and discuss the way we might work together.

### Disscussion

After we both introduced our projects, we exchanged our thoughts about each other's project.

**Questions & Advice From XJTLU-CHINA**

1. They would like to know how we will interact with and educate the public.

    A: We have made questionnaires to evaluate their knowledge related to antibiotics,
    probiotics, and microorganisms.
    We are also planning to make some handouts
    and deliver a lecture about it in a high school.

1. They were interested in the specific design of our plasmids.
    Specifically,
    it's about how and why we choose each part of the plasmid for surface display.

    A: We applied three microorganisms
    and the whole team was divided into three groups,
    each responsible for E. coli,
    Yeast cell and *Lactococcus* lactis.
    All groups applied a strategy
    which conjugates the targeted nanobody with a surface protein that is to be expressed,
    transported and located to the extracellular space.
    The surface protein and the targeted nanobody were connected with a linker sequence,
    and each nanobody is marked with at least one protein tag for their identification.
    We also provided links to igem parts so they can check it directly.

**Questions & Advice From DKU**

1. Will the biofilter be blocked due to *E. coli* proliferation?\
    A: The microorganisms are immobilized in filters,
    and the filtration condition may not allow *E. coli* to grow at such a speed.

1. The csgA protein's ability to absorb heavy metal ions under different conditions
    (like pH) can be tested through experiments.
    For example, we can put csg protein into a certain amount of wastewater,
    then adjust the pH and check the remaining concentration of metal ions in time,
    so we can acquire a proper pH for the protein to capture heavy metal ions.

### Cooperation plan

After the Q&A session, we discussed several
key topics that might be helpful to the project design.

- **Model for bacteria growth**\
    XJTLU-CHINA has developed a model for predicting bacteria growth,
    and it might also be applied to our situation by adjusting some of the parameters.
- **Quantified expression of csg through controlling IPTG concentration**\
    XJTLU-CHINA intended
    to control the expression of csg protein by adjusting the amount of IPTG inducer,
    which can also be a helpful approach for our team to check the relationship
    between the cell-cell adhesion affinity and the number of expressed nanobodies.
    However, as we also applied the TlpA promotor,
    it may influence the actual expression to a great extent
    and cause a big difference from the theoretical calculation.
    As a result, this approach remains to be a concern.
- **Detection and measurement of displayed csg protein**\
    XJTLU-CHINA controlled the expression level by adjusting inducer concentration
    and estimated the expression by calculating theoretically, which might be a
    possible direction for us to consider.
- **The condition of csg and heavy metal ions after the death of *E. coli* cells**\
    We consider that the heavy metal ions will remain captured,
    as protein itself has a great affinity to the heavy metal ions.
    But, it remains to be seen
    whether the released protein will leak out from the filter, and this requires
    more work.
- **Supplement of experimental materials**\
  We would like to give special thanks to team XJTLU for providing us the
  csg sequence for wet-lab.
