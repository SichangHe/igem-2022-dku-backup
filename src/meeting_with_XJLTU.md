### Questions & advice from XJLTU:

1. They would like to know how will we interact with and educate the public.\
    A: We have made questionnaires to evaluate their knowledge related to antibiotic,
    probiotics, and microorganism.
    We are also planning to make some handouts
    and deliver a lecture about it in a high school.

1. They were interested in the specific design of our plasmids.
    Specifically,
    it's about how and why we choose each part of the plasmid for surface display.\
    A: We applied three microorganisms
    and the whole team was divided into three groups,
    each responsible of E. coli,
    Yeast cell and Lactococcus lactis.
    All groups applied a strategy
    which conjugates the targeted nanobody with a surface protein that is to be expressed,
    transported and located to the extracellular space.
    The surface protein and the targeted nanobody is connected with a linker sequence,
    and each

### Questions & advice from DKU:

1. Will the bio filter be blocked due to E. coli proliferation?\
    A: The microorganisms are immobialized<!-- TODO: typo --> in filters,
    and the filtration condition may not allow E. coli to grow at such a speed.

1. The csg protein's ability to absorb heavy metal ions under different conditions
    (like pH) can be tested through experiment.

### Discussion topics:

- Model for bacteria growth\
    The XJLTU developed a model for predicting bacteria growth,
    and it may also be applied to our situation by adjusting some of the parameters.
- Quantitated<!-- TODO: typo --> expression of csg through controlling amount of IPTG\
    The XJLTU team applied a way
    to control the expression of csg protein by adjusting the amount of IPTG inducer,
    which can also be helpful for our team.
    However, as we also applied the TlpA promotor,
    which may influence the actual expression to a great extent
    and cause a big difference from theoretical calculation,
    so this approach remains to be concerned.
    Detection and measurement of displayed csg protein.
- The condition of csg and heavy metal ions after death of E. coli cells\
    We consider that the heavy metal ions will remain to be captured,
    as protein itself has great affinity to the heavy metal ions.
    But, it remains to be seen
    that if the released protein will be leaking out from the filter.
