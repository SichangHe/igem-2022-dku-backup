We designed cell surface display platforms for probiotics including yeast,
E.*coli* Nissle 1917, and L.*lactis*. To be specific, the yeast Aga2 surface
display platform for nanobodies were developed,  We also designed a novel way
to detect protein surface expression by using flow cytometry. Another
contribution is protein modeling protocol. We designed an integrated protocol
involving the usage of PyMol, RobeTTA, and Alphafold2. Through literature
review, we were able to determine multiple parameters that measure the accuracy
of the protein model, and conducted evaluation on our protein design.

### Cell surface display platforms

Cell surface display platforms can be utilized to cater to many protein
engineering and therapeutic drug design purposes. In our case, the therapeutic
effect and the nanobody localization on the cellular membrane of yeast yields
future possibilities for iGEM teams to utilize this surface display platform
based on the yeast Aga2 protein, specifically for therapeutic designs, but
possible to be utilized to express other proteins as well.

### Integrated protein modeling protocol

Online programs are helpful for visualizing and analyzing the structure of
different proteins and their docking scenarios. We use Robetta and Alphafold2
to model the structures of our protein, and used HADDOCK to visualize the
docking structure. Evaluation focuses on different parameters: Ramachandran
plot, Overall G-factors, Atomic Z-score RMS, Percentage of the amino acids
having scored >= 0.2 in the 3D/1D profile, Overall quality factor, and Z-score.
These parameters determine whether a certain structure is stable.
