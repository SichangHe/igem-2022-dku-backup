We designed cell surface display platforms to display nanobodies on probiotics including yeast,
*E.coli* Nissle 1917, and *L.lactis*. We were able to verify the possibility of expressing nanobodies using the Aga2 surface display system. We also designed a novel way
to detect protein surface expression by using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Another
contribution is the protein modeling protocol. We designed an integrated protocol
involving the usage of PyMol, RobeTTA, and Alphafold2. Through literature
review, we were able to determine multiple parameters that measure the accuracy
of the protein model and evaluated our protein design. We also contributed
to previous parts by designing our parts with improvements based on past iGEM teams.
Another contribution is the PCR troubleshooting guide we made during the
collaboration with Duke. It contains actual wet lab gel pictures and troubleshooting advice
for future iGEM teams to reference.
Last but not least,
we created a model for our iGEM team members to collaborate using
GitLab as an open source platform.

## Cell surface display platforms

Cell surface display platforms can be utilized to cater to many protein
engineering and therapeutic drug design purposes. In our case, the therapeutic
effect and the nanobody localization on the cellular membrane of yeast yield
future possibilities for iGEM teams to utilize this surface display platform
based on the yeast Aga2 protein, specifically for therapeutic designs, but
possible to be utilized to express other proteins as well.

## Integrated protein modeling protocol

Online programs help visualize and analyze the structure of
different proteins and their docking scenarios. We use Robetta and Alphafold2
to model the structures of our protein, and used HADDOCK to visualize the
docking structure. The evaluation focuses on different parameters: Ramachandran
plot, Overall G-factors, Atomic Z-score RMS, Percentage of the amino acids
having scored >= 0.2 in the 3D/1D profile, Overall quality factor, and Z-score.
These parameters determine whether a certain structure is stable. For more details, please see our [Model Page](model.md).

### PCR troubleshooting guide for future iGEM teams

In our collaboration with Duke iGEM, we put together a PCR troubleshooting guide, summarizing all the different problems we encountered during PCR in wet lab.

## Collaborations using GitLab

To ease the writing of the Wiki and manage resources efficiently,
we conducted all collaborations within our team using GitLab.
We created
[a monolithic repository for all our documentation](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/sh623/igem-2022-dku)
way before iGEM announced that GitLab will be their new Wiki platform.
And, we use it to track every event and task using GitLab Issues,
including our brainstorming, lab design, and Wiki design process.

GitLab is very helpful for our collaboration.
All issues, responses to issues,
and document changes are well recorded on the Activity tab,
and Due dates and individual assignments are used to
help us finish our tasks in a timely manner.
GitLab CI allows us to build our Wiki and preview it after every push
without manual intervention.
The power of Git also enables us to track down mistakes made to our Wiki.

We believe that our model collaborating using GitLab is a good reference for
future iGEM teams
so we decided to open source our repository to help them
scale their documentation project well.
