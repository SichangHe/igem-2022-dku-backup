## Contribution
We designed cell surface display platforms for probiotics including yeast, E.*coli* Nissle 1917, and L.*lactis*. We also designed detection protocols of the surface display systems. 
### Cell surface display platforms 
Cell surface display platforms can be utilized to cater to many protein engineering and therapeutic drug design purposes. In our case, the therapeutic effect and the nanobody localization on the cellular membrane of yeast yields future possibilities for iGEM teams to utilize this surface display platform based on the yeast Aga2 protein, specifically for therapeutic designs, but possible to be utilized to express other proteins as well.
