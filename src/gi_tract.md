## GI tract & Probiotics Brochure

### GI Tract

The human GI (Gastrointestinal) tract consists of stomach (pH = 2),
small intestine (pH = 4-5),
and large intestine (pH = 7),
which comprises 200 m^2 of surface area in total (**Figure 1**).
It is responsible for the digestion of food and absorption of nutrients.

### GI Microbiome

A normal functioning human body contains the visible human organs,
such as the heart,
lung,
brain etc.
containing 10^-14 cells (~23000 genes),
and the invisible microbiome,
which is a group of up to 10^-14 million microbes (~9 million genes)
that live in your body.
These bacteria help with digestion,
destroys harmful bacteria,
and helps control your immune system.
The interaction between the host (human) and its microbiota is complex;
thus,
knowing the human microbiome helps with the development of
biomarkers for predicting predisposition to diseases,
designing targeted therapies,
personalized drug therapies and probiotics.

The GI microbiota contains 10^13 to 10^14 microbial cells.
Microbes in gut affect early development,
health,
and predisposition to disease.
The microbial colonization of gut begins at birth.
As is shown in **Figure 2**,
from sampling data of the human microbiome project,
in the GI tract,
the species *Bacteroidetes* and *Firmicutes* have the highest abundance,
followed by *Proteobacteria*,
*Tenericutes*,
and others.
The microbial population in different areas of the GI tract are influenced by
diet and the physical conditions in the area.
In the stomach and small intestine,
the low pH level prevents the growth and colonization of many microbials;
however,
*Firmicutes*,
*Bacteroidetes*,
and *Actinobacteria* are commonly found in the gastric fluid,
while *Firmicutes* and *Proteobacteria* are common in the mucus layer of the stomach.
Some pathogens,
such as *Helicobacter pylori*,
are also discovered in the gastric mucosa.

**Figure 3** | Different microenvironments in the large intestine.[^Brock]

The microbiome in the large intestine generally serves as
an in vivo fermentation vessel,
with the microbiota using nutrients derived from the digestion of food
(**Figure 3**).
The essential biochemical and metabolic contributions of
intestinal microorganisms contain different types of vitamins (e.g.,
thiamine,
riboflavin,
pyridoxine,
B12,
K,
etc.),
amino acids (e.g.,
asparagine,
glutamate,
methionine,
etc.),
gases (e.g.,
CO2,
CH4,
H2),
odor,
organic acids,
glycosidase reactions,
and steroid metabolism.
As a result,
the pathological changes in the GI tract microbiome may lead to deficiencies in
important metabolic reactions (e.g.,
lack of vitamin B12 may lead to pernicious anemia
– the red blood cells cannot function well).

### GI Microbiome, Antibiotics, and Probiotics

Currently,
physicians usually recommend using antibiotics when treating GI tract bacterial infections.
However,
since antibiotics usually also kill the beneficial microbiota,
it increases the risk of developing IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) after treatment.
IBD is characterized of chronic inflammation of the GI tract,
which may result in irreversible damage.
In addition,
some antibiotics can cause ADR (adverse drug reaction) and allergies.
Therefore,
the development of alternative treatment methods,
such as the use of probiotics,
have attracted much attention.
Unlike antibiotics,
probiotics do not kill all the bacteria in an unbolted way.
They help inhibit the growth of pathogens
and preserve the healthy microbiota via competitive exclusion,
anti-adherence,
etc.
Recently,
engineered probiotics have also become a hot topic for new drug development.
