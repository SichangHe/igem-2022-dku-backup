Biology team:  Yixuan Wu organized wet lab and human practice as the biology
team leader. Yixuan Wu, Yuxin Wang, and Chang Shen developed the project
design. Wet lab experiments are performed by Yixuan Wu, Yunyi Ru, Chang Shen,
Jingyun Jin, Yuxin Wang, Lingrui Lai, Qizhou Jiang, Zhujun Yao, Yixuan Liu,
Sihan Wang. Dry lab is designed by Zhenyu Xu and Yixuan Wu, performed by Zhenyu
Xu, Sichang He, Yuxiang He and Jasmine Santos. Wiki is built by Sichang He,
Yuxiang He and Zhenyu Xu. Promotion Video is shot and edited by Zhenyu Xu,
narrated by Yixuan Wu. Fund is managed by Renwei Gao. Wet lab expenses and
supplies are supported by Duke Kunshan University Dii program and Wang-Cai
Biochemistry Lab with the generosity of Dr. Linfeng Huang. The whole team
participated in human practices, with the additional support of Dr. Floyd
Beckford at Duke Kunshan University and Dr. Neel Joshi from Northwestern
University.
