## Journal Club
In order to have better educational effect and promote our project, we
organized the Journal Club activity in the Duke Kunshan community.

The first Journal Club was held on April 30th, 2022. At the very beginning of
the meeting, Yuyang, the leader of last year's iGEM team, gave a speech for us
and introduced in detail what systems biology is and the basic methods of
studying systems biology. This journal club event mainly focused on COVID-19
and then developed into three sub-topics including the antigen test for
SARS-CoV-2 introduced by Kathy, human ACE2 receptor & TM air freshening spray
presented by Irene, and COVID-19 Vaccines explained by Bruce. Apart from the
iGEM team, around 10 freshman students with various backgrounds participated in
the sharing and raised many inspiring questions.
