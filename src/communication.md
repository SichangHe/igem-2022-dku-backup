# Communication
### Overview
We had science communications during different stages of our project. We designed these communications to have different manner, audience and scope, aiming at informing, educating, raising awareness of the topic of Gastrointestinal health, and increasing the sense of wonder about fighting agianst antibiotic resistance. 

### Socially-Oriented Questionnaire
Before the experiment, we designed and published a questionnaire about antibiotic treatment and dysentery on social network platform, and obtained more than 500 responses from people of different regions, age groups and education levels in China. We found that many people, although aware of dysentery, do not know how it is transmitted or the bacteria that causes it. This makes us realize the importance of science popularization. Meanwhile, people have different levels of concern about antibiotic resistance, which means it is necessary for us to focus on antibiotic therapy replacement.

### On-Campus Communication
As an undergraduate team, we participated in the 2022's College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program—a national training program for college students on innovation and entrepreneurship. In this way, we can better promote the topic of synthetic biology to the DKU community and attract more fresh blood to participate in innovation. We made posters and participated in project exhibitions, and were regularly inspected by the jury on campus. In addition, we have established a journal club, where different members of the team introduce cutting-edge knowledge about synthetic biology every two weeks, and we are happy to see many freshmen participating.

### CCiC: iGEM community in China
In order to carry out science communications on a larger scale, we participated the 9th CCiC Conference (Conference of China iGEMer Community), which is a national summit independently initiated by Chinese iGEM teams, aiming to provide a platform for iGEM teams to share resources and promote mutual learning and communication. We made poster and presented at the conference, answering questions from the audience and judges. After the conference, we collaborated with team LZU on science popularization about probiotics.

### Local School Education
In the later stage of the experiment, in order to better promote the knowledge of synthetic biology and gastrointestinal health in the local area, we contacted a local international high school and successfully delivered popular science lectures to more than 330 middle and high school students and teachers.We distributed science manuals to everyone in the audience and introduced the GI tract, dysentery, probiotic therapy, and antibiotic resistance.

### Summary
Throughout the project, we never stopped science communication with different groups. The social questionnaire allowed us to identify the need for the program; the school publicity has attracted a batch of fresh blood to join the research and innovation of synthetic biology; the communication and cooperation with other Chinese IGEM teams enabled us to learn more knowledge, and also to understand the current issues of synthetic biology in China that deserve attention. The science popularization and education in local schools also gave us the opportunity to communicate with middle and high school students, understand their ideas and answer their doubts.
