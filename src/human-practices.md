# Integrated Human Practice

Antibiotic resistance is a problem in its scale and subtlety. 
Shigella infection has its significance in antibiotic resistance because of its identity as one of the most antibiotic resistant bacterias recognized by CDC. In our integrated human practice, we followed the procedure of research-design-engagement-modification. 

## Recognizing the problem

The subtlety of antibiotic resistance did not come to mind until some of the team members took the microbiology class at DKU: 
From the amazing lectures given by Dr. Linfeng Huang, we realized that the race against bacterial infection is largely dependent on discoveries of newly synthesized drugs. People modify the drug molecule by perhaps a small sidechain, changing the chemical property but perhaps not changing the chemical property. This can lead to significant advances because it can possibly alter the pathogen's ability to recognize the drug, therefore no longer maintain its resistance. 

Antibiotics are thus labeled as the best weapon. It is almost always the solution to infections. It can be bought at ordinary pharmacies, and are consumed at a scale larger than ever. From talking with the people around us, we realized that the lack of knowledge of antibiotic resistance exists as possibly a larger threat than the pathogen itself. 

We ask ourselves: What if one day, we have exhausted all the combinations of chemicals? What if we lose the race because we have strengthened antibiotic resistance to the point of no return?

And clearly this has been considered. The field of immunology has become more heated than ever before. What if we could deploit the weapon that is the gift of the creation-our own immune systems?
