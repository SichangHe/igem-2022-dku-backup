We participated in 2022 online DKU club expo,
introducing IGEM club to international students.
Our club aims to share frontier knowledge and technologies of synthetic biology.
In addition, we also seek for potential team members of the DKU iGEM team next year.
Club activities are conducted by student presentations
and speeches given by guest speakers.
The iGEM teamwork is divided into 4 parts,
biological experiments,
modeling,
wiki design and human practice.
New club members are welcomed to select the parts which they are interested in to participate in the competition.

For the offline club expo,
we also made a small presentation to spread common knowledge about probiotics
and provided our advice for consuming commercial probiotic products.
Our central idea is that the aim of commercial probiotic products
should be limited to minor gut discomforts or hoping to improve general health,
and long-term consumption is not suggested by doctors we consulted.
Also, we introduced some potential harms of consuming probiotics,
trying to give the audience
a full image of the commonly advertised probiotic products.
We also brought some lab consumables,
such as microcentrifuge tubes and agar plates,
to introduce some basic lab skills.
Students who attended the club expo can get basic knowledge of
how to streak in an agar plate
and how to use micropipette and centrifuge machines.
Besides providing basic knowledge and doing the offline presentation,
we prepared some interesting questions related to Biology and gut microbiomes
for college students from all majors to answer in order to enlarge the students' knowledge about gut microbiomes
and biology.
The questions include "how H. pylori were proved to be able to cause ulcers,"
"pick out the probiotics from several names of microorganisms,"
"estimate the number of microorganisms in their stomach", etc.
