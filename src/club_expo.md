We participated in 2022 online DKU club expo,
introducing IGEM club to international students.
Our club is meant to share knowledge and techniques of biosynthesis
and to seek for potential team members of DKU IGEM team next year.
The relevant club activities are conducted in the form of student presentation
and speeches given by guest speakers.
The IGEM team composition has also been introduced to
DKU students from class of 2026.
We divided IGEM teamwork into 4 parts,
biological experiments,
modelling,
wiki design and human practice.

For the offline club expo,
we also made a small presentation to spread common knowledge about probiotics
and provided our advice for consuming commercial probiotic products.
Our central idea is that the aim of commercial probiotic products
should be limited to minor gut discomforts or hoping to improve general health,
and long-term consumption is not suggested by doctors we consulted.
Also, we introduced some potential harms of consuming probiotics,
trying to give them <!-- todo: what is them -->
a full image of the commonly advertised probiotic products.
We brought some experimental equipment,
such as microcentrifuge tubes and plates,
to introduce some basic experimental skills.
Students who attended the club expo got basic knowledge of
how to streak in an agar plate
and how to use micropipette and centrifuge machines.
Besides providing basic knowledge and doing the offline presentation,
we prepared some interesting questions related to Biology and gut microbiomes
for college students from all majors.
They were designed to enlarge their knowledge about gut microbiomes
and make biology interesting.
The questions include "how H. pylori were proved to be able to cause ulcers,"
"pick out the probiotics from several names of microorganisms,"
"estimate the number of microorganisms in their stomach,"
and so on.
