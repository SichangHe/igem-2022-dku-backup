## Project Description
The Shigella species is listed as one of the eight dangerous drug resistant bacteria[^CDC,2019], with associated mortalities projected to rise to 10 million globally by 2050. The use of conventional antibiotics aggravates the multidrug resistance of most Shigella strains. Besides aiding in the selection of resistant pathogens, antibiotics reduce intestinal species diversity and population, and disrupt the defensive, metabolic, and trophic functions of interdependent microbes [^Francino,2016]. Engineered probiotics with cell surface display systems are promising in tackling this problem due to a weaker selective pressure and specific binding proteins that are less likely to disrupt the host gut microbiome. Through literature review, E.*coli* Nissle 1917, yeast and L.*lactis* are chosen for expression because their probiotic nature present no known harm to the GI tract and the convenience in lab culturing.

Shigella, as one of the most antibiotic resistant pathogens, poses a great threat to food safety especially in developing areas.
10 million will be subject to mortalities caused by shigella infection by 2050.

Distribution of antibiotics is the main treatment as of today. It is costly and time consuming. Side effects include degration of GI tract microbiome, and the emergence of more antibiotic resistant strains.

We are in an endless race against pathogens. 
Antibiotics are our weapons. Mutations are their secrets to survival. 
Now, DKU iGEM team has proposed an alternative to jump out of this race and possibly, go far beyond.

Antibody therapy is a popular topic in therapeutics. 
It is different from antibiotics and can be more effective when triggering the host immune system.

However, conventional antibodies have a high cost because of the complicated synthesis procedure, and can be vulnerable to proteosomes in the GI tract. 

Thus we propose a novel method to display nanobodies on the surface of probiotics. It exploits the natural pathogen inhibition effects of the probiotics. It also explores possibilities of antibody therapy mass production. Click on the left menu to learn more about the details.
