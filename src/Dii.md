## 2022 College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program
We participated in 2022's College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training
Program—a national training program for college students on innovation and entrepreneurship.
It encourages students to participate in scientific research, technological development,
and entrepreneurship.

During the final pitch,
Lisa Wu and Lingrui Lai made the presentation about our project of Shigella treatment
using the concept of of synthetic biology.
Lingrui went through the basic concept of shigella and synthetic biology,
then,
the current challenges that we are facing for shigella treatment
and our suggestions.  
Lisa introduced the methodology involved and techniques used in our project.
At the end they stressed the significance of our project.

Judgers include Kai Huang (Division Chair of Natural and Applied Sciences of DKU),
Joohyun Lee (Assistant professor of biology of DKU),
Anastasia Tsigkou (Associate Professor of Biology of DKU),
Ming-Chun Huang (Associate professor of data and computational science of DKU),
Liqi Ren (Associate Director for Innovation and Entrepreneurship).

After the presentation,
Prof. Lee and Dr. Tsigkou presented valuable questions and suggestions.

Prof. Lee recognized the difficulty of antibody therapy and
informed us of the clear restrictions of FDI approval.
We assured him that our project nanobodies are thoroughly researched,
and that we will continue to modify the project to enhance biosafety.
Dr. Tsigkou asked us about the binding affinity test and false positive.
This is a question that did not come to us then, so we answered that
the detection is conduct through fluorescence microscopy.

After discussion with our PI, Prof. Linfeng Huang,
we decide that we will use the pull down method
in the detection of binding affinity.
We will conduct the experiment by pulling down on
both sides of the nanobody-antigen complex.
For false positives, DKU iGEM member Lingrui Lai suggested isotype testing.
