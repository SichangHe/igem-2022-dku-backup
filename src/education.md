## Overview

Education along with science communication is important for us.
There are many reasons for that –- unprofessional formal school education,
emerging fake news, and increasing conflicts and misunderstanding between science and the public.
Therefore, we devoted ourselves to narrowing the gap between science and the public and encouraging communications about synthetic biology.
Our consultations are presented in detail on Communication.
This year, we conduct popular science education both on and off campus.

- On campus, we have established a journal club, where different members of the
team introduced cutting-edge knowledge about synthetic biology every two weeks,
and we are happy to see many freshmen participating. We also cohosted a Biology Seminar Series,
inviting Prof. Dong Hyun Jo, from Seoul National University College of Medicine
to give a talk on therapeutic revolution for the DKU community.

- Off campus, we contacted a local international high school and successfully delivered popular science lectures
to more than 330 middle and high school students and teachers about our project
and synthetic biology.

## On-campus education
### Wang-Cai Biology Seminar Series

![Wang-Cai Talk](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4161/wiki/wang-cai-talk.jpeg)

In this Wang-Cai biology seminar series, the DKU iGEM team was honored to co-host
the speech delivered by Prof. Dong Hyun Jo from Seoul National University College
of Medicine.
The talk was titled "Therapeutic Revolution: Application of Novel Technologies",
where Dr. Jo introduced the brief history and therapeutic development
for one specific type of cancer, retinoblastoma.

Dr. Jo is an assistant professor at Seoul National University College of Medicine
in the Republic of Korea. He had his medical degree at
Seoul National University in 2007. In 2012, Dr. Jo received a residency at the
Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University Hospital, and in 2016,
he received his Ph.D. at Seoul National University. Dr. Jo's research interest
focuses on 3 aspects. The first is the development of novel therapeutic
approaches against retinal diseases. The second is the molecular mechanisms of
physiological and pathological angiogenesis in the retina and associated organs,
the third is translational research on retinoblastoma.

At the end of the talk, Dr. Jo shared his career pathway as both a physician and
a researcher. The devotion he made to the clinical therapy of retinoblastoma and
the improvement of the health of his patients made him feel that biomedical
sciences are not limited to theoretical knowledge, but rather quite practical
and can benefit the whole population. The experience and thoughts expressed by
Dr. Jo greatly inspired us, which allow us to have more understanding of graduate
choices and future career plans.

### Journal Club
In order to have better educational effect and promote our project , we
organized the Journal Club activity in the Duke Kunshan community.

The first Journal Club was held on April 30th, 2022. At the very beginning of
the meeting, Yuyang, the leader of last year's iGEM team, gave a speech for us
and introduced in detail what systems biology is and the basic methods of
studying systems biology. This journal club event mainly focused on COVID-19
and then developed into three sub-topics including the antigen test for
SARS-CoV-2 introduced by Kathy, human ACE2 receptor & TM air freshening spray
presented by Irene, and COVID-19 Vaccines explained by Bruce. Apart from the
iGEM team, around 10 freshman students with various backgrounds participated in
the sharing and raised many inspiring questions.

## Club Expo

![Club expo figure 1](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4161/wiki/club-expo1.jpg)

We participated in 2022 online DKU club expo,
introducing IGEM club to international students.
Our club aims to share frontier knowledge and technologies of synthetic biology.
In addition, we also seek for potential team members of the DKU iGEM team next year.
Club activities are conducted by student presentations
and speeches given by guest speakers.
The iGEM teamwork is divided into 4 parts,
biological experiments,
modelling,
wiki design and human practice.
New club members are welcomed to select the parts which they are interested in to participate in the competition.

For the offline club expo,
we also made a small presentation to spread common knowledge about probiotics
and provided our advice for consuming commercial probiotic products.
Our central idea is that the aim of commercial probiotic products
should be limited to minor gut discomforts or hoping to improve general health,
and long-term consumption is not suggested by doctors we consulted.
Also, we introduced some potential harms of consuming probiotics,
trying to give the audience
a full image of the commonly advertised probiotic products.
We also brought some lab consumables,
such as microcentrifuge tubes and agar plates,
to introduce some basic lab skills.
Students who attended the club expo can get basic knowledge of
how to streak in an agar plate
and how to use micropipette and centrifuge machines.
Besides providing basic knowledge and doing the offline presentation,
we prepared some interesting questions related to Biology and gut microbiomes
for college students from all majors to answer in order to enlarge the students' knowledge about gut microbiomes
and biology.
The questions include "how H. pylori were proved to be able to cause ulcers,"
"pick out the probiotics from several names of microorganisms,"
"estimate the number of microorganisms in their stomach,"
and so on.

## Off-campus education

This year, expanding iGEM participants and audience was included in the goals of our human practice. Although iGEM competition has a solid audience base in universities,
students in high schools have little knowledge of iGEM competition or give up
because of their limitation of conducting wet labs. After having an overview of high schools in Kunshan,
we decided to contact Dipont Huayao Collegiate School Kunshan to give a speech.

In the first part of our presentation, we introduced the biology team, the modeling team,
the wiki team and the human practice team,
including their work and collaborations between different subgroups.
This part gave high school students an overview of what is iGEM and what they can do.

In China, people often use stomachache or feel uncomfortable at the stomach
to summarize almost every disease of the digestive tract. This could lead to medical issues.
For example, people may choose to take OTC stomach medicines instead of going
to a doctor.
Symptoms may get remission.
However, this can lay an underlying problem in the future, such as changing the gut microbiota.\
To help the public have a better understanding of digesting,
we popularized GI Microbiome and GI tract. The functions of each human organ
and different intestinal floras were explained in detail.
Along with knowledge, we provided two fun facts --"Mom passes gut microbiota to baby"
and "Having stomachache and diarrhea before exams".
We also mentioned the harm that using antibiotics can do to the gastrointestinal tract.
Along with distributing brochures, our audience understood the basic knowledge of GI
parts. Here is our brochure. <https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4161/wiki/aqua-and-purple-medical-trifold-brochure.pdf>

In China, there is an increasing trend of taking probiotic products.
Along with the trend, multiple probiotic products flooded into the health product
market. With fancy advertisements and product patents or logos of importing,
it is hard for consumers to choose the right products.
So, we decided to give the popularization of science which is corresponded
to this problem.

In this part, we introduced three kinds of probiotics that products mainly contain:
*Bifidobacterium*, *Lactobacillus*, and *Enterococcus*.
We mentioned their functions and some potential negative effects
that these probiotic strains may lead to.
We provided our advice for consuming probiotics and how to choose relevant
products at last.

To conclude, we aim to teach people about the GI tract and probiotics in a more interesting
and effective way.
We first contact Dipont Huayao Collegiate School Kunshan to
confirm our target audience, high school students and teachers.
So, we decided on the educational level of our presentation to make sure students
and teachers can have a better understanding of basic knowledge.
For key concepts and academic terms, we annotated them in Chinese as well.
To promote our audience to be more engaged in our presentation,
we shared fun facts about the GI tract and decorated our slides with fancy pictures.
We also dove deeper into the concept of a healthy gut and understand
how they will articulate the problem of the GI tract through our Q&A session.
Through this presentation, more than 330 middle and high school students and
teachers had a basic knowledge of GI and probiotics and knew iGEM competitions further.
We will build further collaborations with Dipont Huayao Collegiate School Kunshan.
We are looking forward to helping them build their iGEM team and having more communications
about synthetic biology.

## Summary
In conclusion, we invited different audiences to engage in communication about
synthetic biology this year.
In our activities, we aimed to not only teach other people but also learn new things
by ourselves.
Education is seldom one way of teaching and learning. During the process of
conducting education activities, we dove deeper into different contexts and
understand problems from multiple perspectives.
We gained lots of insights from external sources, such as professors, companies,
literature etc.\
On-campus education allows us to better transfer knowledge about synthetic
biology and *Shigella* treatment to our students, as well as gathering fresh
blood for the next year's team.
Science popularization and education in local schools also gave us the opportunity to communicate with middle and high school students,
understand their ideas and answer their doubts.
We have accumulated several key conclusions for everyone aiming to have
any influence through education in iGEM:

- Connect to
people from different institutions and organizations as much as possible --- thus
you can understand problems or think from different perspectives.
- Keep in touch with collaborators whoever you have cooperated with --- you may
build lasting cooperations that other teams did not have.
- Think outside the box but also think within the box - experience from those who
have worked on your topic before is important.
- Know your audience – when organizing an event or giving a presentation,
consider the types of your target audience.
