**Overview:**

We conduct popular science education both on and off campus.

- On campus, we have established a journal club, where different members of the
team introduce cutting-edge knowledge about synthetic biology every two weeks,
and we are happy to see many freshmen participating. We also cohosted a Biology Seminar Series,
inviting Prof. Dong Hyun Jo, from Seoul National University College of Medicine
to give a talk on therapeutic revolution for the DKU community.

- Off campus, we contacted a local international high school and successfully delivered popular science lectures
to more than 330 middle and high school students and teachers about our project
and synthetic biology.

### Off campus education
Although iGEM competition has a solid audience base in **universities**,
students in high schools have little knowledge of iGEM competition or give up
because of their limitation of conducting wetlabs. There is an increasing trend
of taking probiotic products. However, there is lack of common sense of
probiotics.

To narrow the gap between public and science, we contacted with Dipont Huayao
Collegiate School Kunshan, a local high school. We introduced iGEM competition
and popularize the knowledge of GI tract and probiotics by giving a
presentation. **In the introduction of iGEM**, we introduced biology team,
modelling team, wiki team and human practice team, including their
responsibility and collaborations between different subgroups.

**For GI tract**, we introduced the process of digesting. Functions of each
human organ and different intestinal floras were explained in detail. Along
with knowledge, we provided two fun facts——“Mom passes gut microbiota to
baby” and “Having stomachache and diarrhea before exams”. Besides GI
tract, we also mentioned the harm that using antibiotics can do to
gastrointestinal tract.

**For probiotics**, we popularized basic knowledge of probiotics, pointed out
issues that taking probiotics improperly will lead to and give our advice.
After the speech, 330 high school students and teachers had a better
understanding of choosing probiotic products. Students and teachers interested
in participating in iGEM competition consulted with us about the future iGEM
cooperations.

### On campus educaiton
#### Wang-cai speach
from Sihan

####  Journal club
In order to have better educational effect and promote our project , we
organized the Journal Club activity in the Duke Kunshan community.

The first Journal Club was held on April 30th, 2022. At the very beginning of
the meeting, Yuyang, the leader of last year's iGEM team, gave a speech for us
and introduced in detail what systems biology is and the basic methods of
studying systems biology. This journal club event mainly focused on COVID-19
and then developed into three sub-topics including the antigen test for
SARS-CoV-2 introduced by Kathy, human ACE2 receptor & TM air freshening spray
presented by Irene, and COVID-19 Vaccines explained by Bruce. Apart from the
iGEM team, around 10 freshman students with various backgrounds participated in
the sharing and raised many inspiring questions.

### Summary

We have devoted in several education activities.
On-campus education allows us to better transfer knowledge about synthetic
biology and shigella treatment to our students, as well as gather fresh
blood for the next year's team.
The science popularization and education in local school also gives
us the opportunity to communicate with middle and high school students,
understand their ideas and answer their doubts.
