Although iGEM competition has a solid audience base in **universities**,
students in high schools have little knowledge of iGEM competition or give up
because of their limitation of conducting wetlabs. There is an increasing trend
of taking probiotic products. However, there is lack of common sense of
probiotics.

To narrow the gap between public and science, we contacted with Dipont Huayao
Collegiate School Kunshan, a local high school. We introduced iGEM competition
and popularize the knowledge of GI tract and probiotics by giving a
presentation. **In the introduction of iGEM**, we introduced biology team,
modelling team, wiki team and human practice team, including their
responsibility and collaborations between different subgroups.

**In GI tract**, we introduced the process of digesting. Functions of each
human organ and different intestinal floras were explained in detail. Along
with knowledge, we provided two fun facts——“Mom passes gut microbiota to
baby” and “Having stomachache and diarrhea before exams”. Besides GI
tract, we also mentioned the harm that using antibiotics can do to
gastrointestinal tract.

**In probiotics**, we popularized basic knowledge of probiotics, pointed out
issues that taking probiotics improperly will lead to and give our advice.
After the speech, 330 high school students and teachers had a better
understanding of choosing probiotic products. Students and teachers interested
in participating in iGEM competition consulted with us about the future iGEM
cooperations.
