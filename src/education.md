**Overview:**

We conduct popular science education both on and off campus.

- On campus, we have established a journal club, where different members of the
team introduce cutting-edge knowledge about synthetic biology every two weeks,
and we are happy to see many freshmen participating. We also cohosted a Biology Seminar Series,
inviting Prof. Dong Hyun Jo, from Seoul National University College of Medicine
to give a talk on therapeutic revolution for the DKU community.

- Off campus, we contacted a local international high school and successfully delivered popular science lectures
to more than 330 middle and high school students and teachers about our project
and synthetic biology.

### Off campus education
Although iGEM competition has a solid audience base in **universities**,
students in high schools have little knowledge of iGEM competition or give up
because of their limitation of conducting wetlabs. There is an increasing trend
of taking probiotic products. However, there is lack of common sense of
probiotics.

To narrow the gap between public and science, we contacted with Dipont Huayao
Collegiate School Kunshan, a local high school. We introduced iGEM competition
and popularize the knowledge of GI tract and probiotics by giving a
presentation. **In the introduction of iGEM**, we introduced biology team,
modelling team, wiki team and human practice team, including their
responsibility and collaborations between different subgroups.

**For GI tract**, we introduced the process of digesting. Functions of each
human organ and different intestinal floras were explained in detail. Along
with knowledge, we provided two fun facts——“Mom passes gut microbiota to
baby” and “Having stomachache and diarrhea before exams”. Besides GI
tract, we also mentioned the harm that using antibiotics can do to
gastrointestinal tract.

**For probiotics**, we popularized basic knowledge of probiotics, pointed out
issues that taking probiotics improperly will lead to and give our advice.
After the speech, 330 high school students and teachers had a better
understanding of choosing probiotic products. Students and teachers interested
in participating in iGEM competition consulted with us about the future iGEM
cooperations.

### On campus education
#### Wang-Cai Biology Seminar Series

![Wang-Cai Talk](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4161/wiki/wang-cai-talk.jpeg)

In this Wang-Cai biology seminar series, the DKU iGEM team was honored to co-host the speech delivered by Prof. Dong Hyun Jo from Seoul National University College of Medicine. The talk was titled “Therapeutic Revolution: Application of Novel Technologies”, where Dr Jo introduced the brief history and therapeutic development for one specific type of cancer, retinoblastoma. 

Dr Jo is the assistant professor of Seoul National University College of Medicine in Republic of Korea. He had his medical degree at Seoul National University in 2007. In 2012, Dr Jo received residency at the Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University Hospital, and in 2016, he received his PhD at Seoul National University. Dr Jo’s research interest focuses on 3 aspects. The first is the development of novel therapeutic approaches against retinal diseases. The second is the molecular mechanisms of physiological and pathological angiogenesis in the retina and associated organs, the third is translational research on retinoblastoma. 

At the end of the talk. Dr. Jo shared his career pathway as both a physician and a researcher. The devotion he made to the clinical therapy of retinoblastoma and the improvement of the health of his patients made him feel that biomedical sciences are not limited to theoretical knowledge, but rather quite practical and can benefit the whole population. The experience and thoughts expressed by Dr. Jo greatly inspired us, which allow us to have more understanding of graduate choices and future career plans. 



####  Journal club
In order to have better educational effect and promote our project , we
organized the Journal Club activity in the Duke Kunshan community.

The first Journal Club was held on April 30th, 2022. At the very beginning of
the meeting, Yuyang, the leader of last year's iGEM team, gave a speech for us
and introduced in detail what systems biology is and the basic methods of
studying systems biology. This journal club event mainly focused on COVID-19
and then developed into three sub-topics including the antigen test for
SARS-CoV-2 introduced by Kathy, human ACE2 receptor & TM air freshening spray
presented by Irene, and COVID-19 Vaccines explained by Bruce. Apart from the
iGEM team, around 10 freshman students with various backgrounds participated in
the sharing and raised many inspiring questions.

### Summary

We have devoted in several education activities.
On-campus education allows us to better transfer knowledge about synthetic
biology and shigella treatment to our students, as well as gather fresh
blood for the next year's team.
The science popularization and education in local school also gives
us the opportunity to communicate with middle and high school students,
understand their ideas and answer their doubts.
