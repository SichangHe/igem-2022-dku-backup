## Interview with Prof Cao

Responses from Huansheng Cao (Notes of Chang Shen):

Our plan is feasible,
and we may engineer more than two probiotics
to ensure the nanobody be successfully displayed.
We may use Alphafold to predict the structure and binding affinity of the nanobody,
then try modifying it to achieve a higher binding affinity.
We discussed about two other topics:
Bio-battery based on bacteria respiration mechanism
and relationship between age and gut microbiota,
but they do not fit the topic of synthetic biology
