## Interview with Prof Cao
We interviewed Huansheng Cao,
Assistant professor of Environmental Science at Duke Kunshan University
for suggestions on our initial lab plans.\
In the interview, team members Yuxin Wang and Chang Shen presented the main design,
bacterial surface display, to consult Prof Cao on its feasibility.
After confirming the rich research foundations of our plan,
he encouraged us to add computational elements to our lab design.\
As a scientist working in computational biology and bioinformatics,
he pointed us to Alphafold2 for the enhancing the binding affinity of our nanobody
and the antigen unit.
As a well-trained biologist, he also suggested
fitting our design to more than one model organisms,
which shows integration in our drug design.\
The interview was full of enthusiasm, so we were able to come across many other topics.
We discussed the trends in bioinformatics and biotechnology,
including bacteria-based bioelectricity,
and the relationship between human longevity and gut microbiota.\
This interview was both encouraging and informative,
and contributed greatly to the first stage of human practice.
