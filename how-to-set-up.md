## what then?
- you should see a folder named `igem-2022-dku` in vs code. open a new vs code window and open this folder, with this folder you can synchronize files with GitLab
- remember, everyone has a copy of this repository on their computer, so store large files like videos elsewhere and leave a link to refer to them
- actually we have another repository https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/sh623/igem-2022-dku-big-files/-/tree/main/
and we use it as a drive. just go to the repository and click the "+" to upload files one by one
