## mechanism
#### a repository
a thing that stores all the project files 
#### git
a program that helps you do version control
#### version control
record and see all changes to a project, and its different branches. show the difference between any versions
#### branches
different series of versions that can exist at the same time, so the versions of the project is like a tree, starting from the main branch which is called "main"
#### branching
making branches, so that the "main branch" does not change when the new branches are changed in case something wrong happens
#### merge
take 2 different versions (usually 1 from the main branch and 1 from another branch) and return 1 version of the project
## action
#### git clone
download the git repository
#### git add
tell git which files to care about
![git add](getting-started-with-git-picture/add.png)
choose the files in vs code and click the "+" button to add them
#### git status
all the information about git in this project
vs code Source Control updates and shows these by default as you see in all these pictures
#### git commit
tell git to record the changes to all the files added (record the files themselves if newly added)
always add some concise description text
![git commit](getting-started-with-git-picture/commit.png)
the commit message will be shown in the commit history
![commit history](getting-started-with-git-picture/commit-history.png)
#### git pull
synchronize changes from the online git repository to your local computer
#### git push
upload your local changes recorded by git to the online git repository
![pull and push](getting-started-with-git-picture/pull-push.png)
notice that you do both in vs code in one click
but also notice that "push" will replace whatever was there in the online git repository
#### git branch
you can access branching in vs code by clicking the "â€¦"
![git branch](getting-started-with-git-picture/branch.png)

you can also enable the Branches tab and edit the branches there![Branches tab in vs code](getting-started-with-git-picture/enable-branches.png)

if you are not sure whether your changes will work, please always create a new branch and edit that branch, and push that branch when you finish, and then merge your branch with the main branch if it works
