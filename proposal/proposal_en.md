# Background information
$Helicobacter$ $pylori$ is a gram-negative bacterium that poses threats to public health. $H.$ $pylori$ infection raises the risks of gastritis, gastroduodenal ulcers, and gastric cancer. Until 2015, 4.4 billion individuals, more than a half of the global population, were estimated to be $H.$ $pylori$-positive, among which South America, Asia, and Africa had the highest prevalence rates around 70% (Hooi et al., 2017). Before long the discovery of $H.$ $pylori$, antimicrobial therapies involving multiple antibiotics have been developed for the eradication of $H.$ $pylori$ (Graham, 2020). However, rising resistance to antibiotics and not enough antibiotic susceptibility testing reduce therapy effectiveness, elongate therapy duration time, and lead to inappropriate use of antibiotics (Savoldi et al., 2018; Saleem & Howden, 2020). Besides, noncompliance of patients raises another challenge of $H.$ $pylori$ eradication. Around 20% of the patients fail to complete treatment due to the adverse effects (Hafeez et al., 2021). Another challenge of current antimicrobial therapy is its potential harm to the homeostasis of human gut microbiome. Antibiotic or proton inhibitors such as PPI that is used in $H.$ $pylori$ treatment can alter the gut microbial composition (Bhalodi et al., 2019), which is correlated with human health.

##Innovation feature
Generally, the innovative idea of our project is to inhibit intestinal bacterial pathogen growth by probiotic-pathogen adhesion. It is achieved by displaying single-domain antibody, or camelid heavy chain-only antibodies (VHH), on the surface of probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 using bacteria cell surface display system. The E. coli Nissle 1917 has the potential to treat bacteria intestinal infections as a probiotic (1). It can also be used as a vector for transporting drugs into intestines (2). The VHH can be used to inhibit pathogen growth and inhibit intracellular pathogen from invading somatic cells (3). To be specific, IpaD (a protein in bacteria type 3 secrete system (T3SS)) of genus Shigella can trigger the downstream cascade involving IpaB and IpaC to assist the translocon pore formation that initiates the invasion of the host cells(8,9). The important features and roles of IpaD in the cytotoxicity of Shigella indicates that IpaD can be a potential target for bacteria de-toxicity and elimination.

This idea combines the antibacterial properties of probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917, VHH and provides a novel approach for target specific drug delivery in intestines. With these antibacterial properties working together, it may achieve a significant effect on treating bacterial intestinal infections. Also, it provides a potential therapy for antibiotic resistant bacteria intestinal infection with a lower price compared to using extracted monoclonal antibody.

Apart from the general idea, the design for achieving the probiotic-pathogen adhesion target also contains some innovative thoughts. First, we chose a bacterial surface display system. There are two options. One is based on E. coli protein YiaT (4), as it is able to display large proteins with molecular mass up to 50 kDa, which makes it hopeful to successfully display single-domain antibodies with molecular mass ranging from 12-15 kDa. The other option is based on intimin. Intimin in E. coli has a trans-outer membrane region and a C-terminal repeat of Ig-like and lectin domains that can be used as a potential fusion site for protein display (14). In some earlier studies, the researchers successfully inserted a fragment of EHEC intimin into a known plasmid vector with a VHH fusing to it and had it successfully express and display the VHH on the bacteria surface (15). Currently no research used such a display system to express and display VHH 20ipaD, JMKH2, and JPSG3 on E. coli surface, which provides an innovation point for our project. Second, we plan to display more than on kind of antibody, so the probiotic can bind to a larger range of pathogens, or it can bind different antigens of the pathogen. Third, the antigen IpaD that VHH can bind to, is highly conservative and exists in all strains of shigella. Also, previous studies have constructed a library of anti-IpaD VHH including VHH 20ipaD, JMKH2, and JPSG3 are found specifically bind to the epitopes in IpaD protein (11,12). The affinity of this antigen-VHH pair is considerable when using 20ipaD and JMKH2 (12).

##Anticipated results from early modelings
Our early modeling result indicated that the project is theoretically feasible.
By using the theory of diffusion (Fick’s Diffusion Law) and parameters from literature review, we modeled the distribution of AMP that is directed to the pathogen by antibodies. For rough estimation, we hypothesize the geometry of probiotics can be simplified as tiny spherical particles with radius R (about $1μm$), and the diffusion of AMP in the gastrointestinal tract was modeled as spherically symmetric concentration profiles.

$$
\Delta C=\frac{1}{r^2}\partial_r(r^2\partial_rC)
$$
($C$: concentration, $r$: the distance from the center of one probiotic sphere)
Stationary situation was the focus, that is
$$
\Delta C=0\\\\[8pt]
\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{d}{dr}(r^2\frac{dc}{dr})=0
$$
Under boundary conditions: $c=c_0$ at $r=R$， $c=c_1$ far from the particle, the solution is
$$
c=(c_0-c_1)\frac{R}{r}+c_1
$$
The model was built on the fact that transport phenomena could happen under the condition of stationary concentration.
The AMP production rate $N$ is expressed by
$$
N=4\pi R^4D(\frac{dc}{dr})_{r=R}
$$
($D$:diffusion coefficient)

Having all these equations, the AMP production rate can be finalized as
$$
N=4\pi DR(c_0-c_1)
$$
Form literature review, the diffusion coefficient $D$ of a 2500 Da AMP in intestinal condition is found to be around $0.5×10^{-10}  m^2\cdot s^{-1}$.
The AMP production rate $N$ is assumed as about 100 AMP/s.
Therefore, $c_0-c_1$ could be calculated as around $0.7 μg/ml$.
