# Zhujun's proposal
## Basic idea
Genetically modify E.coli to produce peptide binding to RBD region of Covid-19. The e.coli is cultured in liquid medium, in a tank filter that acts as a part of clinical or home  ventilation system.
## Rationale
Air ventilation has demonstrated to have beneficial effect in covid setting, especially in reducing PM2.5 and secondly of TVOC [https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/16/8886].In a school setting, measurements and calculation demonstrate that air purifiers potentially represent a well-suited measure to reduce the risks of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 substantially [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2021.1877257]. 
## The peptide
sequence: EAAAKAKLSNENHDNSTVSF   
It has a higher binding affinity with RBD compared to human ACE2.

It has a similar sequence with ACE2, therefore is dangerous to be released in an aerosol form, causing allergy.  
## Killing switch design
Engineered bacteria survive when the concentration of L-arabinose is high enough, but die when is low. L-arabinose is added into the culture medium in the device to ensure that the engineered bacteria could survive and work robustly.

## Other design combined with HEPA filter
1. Add a UV light at the emission of air, which is used to kill evading bacteria (but theoretically they will die because of the killing switch design).
2. Combine with other types of filter: using adsorbent purifier to clear the excess water.
