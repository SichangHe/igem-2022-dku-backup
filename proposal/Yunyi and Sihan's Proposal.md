# Sihan: H. Pylori Detection

## Proposal
The rapid urease test (RUT) and PCR diagnosis of 16S rRNA gene serve as two popular existing methods for the detection of H. pylori. However, false-negative results and a long result waiting time make these methods less reliable and convenient for patients (Khalilpour et al., 2016). In order to increase test accuracy while allowing patients to perform home tests, our team will propose an innovative portable device that provides in vivo detection of H. pylori in saliva samples. Synthetic biology is involved in the product design process. Due to the small amount of H. pylori in saliva, recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is firstly used for amplification. Inspired by the SHERLOCK system, components in RPA are freeze-dried into tablets without damaging bioactivity, and they can be activated by the addition of water and the saliva sample (Nguyen et al., 2021). For color change in detection, it is AuNP-based, depending on aptamer binding with H. pylori. The aptamers included are specially designed using SELEX to target key polymorphisms/variants of virulence factor of H. pylori (CagA, VacA, DupA) positively associated with onset of severe gastric diseases (Alexander et al., 2021). This aims to improve the effectiveness of detection, as instead of including asymptomatic infections, our detection method tries to recognize conditions of H. pylori capable of developing aggressive clinical outcomes to further prevent severe gastrointestinal diseases linked to H. pylori (Alexander et al., 2021).

# Yunyi: H. Pylori Therapeutics

## Proposal
To treat H. pylori infection, we plan to use **nanobody (HCAbs)** (the heavy chain of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)) targeting the urease activity of H. pylori. Urease is an essential enzyme for H. pylori to survive in the stomach, since it converts urea to ammonia, which neutralizes the low-pH environment. If urease activity of H. pylori is blocked by antibody-antigen reaction, H. pylori will no longer tolerate the acidic environment. To find proper HCAbs against urease, we plan to use **nanobody grafting and phagemid display** method. Nanobody grafting matches the heavy chain variable region of a donor mAb against urease to an acceptor HCAb. Then, the HCAbs DNA library created by nanobody grafting are cloned into a phagemid and transferred into an E. coli. With the help of a helper phage M13, a lot of filamentous phages with different HCAbs attached will be produced. After several rounds of washing and eluting, we can find the phage (HCAb) with the highest affinity.
